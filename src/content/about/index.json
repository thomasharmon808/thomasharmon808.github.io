  "content": "I'm a fifth year student at Northeastern University, currently applying for full time jobs starting in May of 2020. At Northeastern I found a passion for back-end software engineering and have gained invaluable real-world experience during numerous internships. I especially enjoy machine learning and working with modern technology stacks. I was originally born and raised in Hawaii, and during my co-ops I have found that it has given me a unique insight and perspective. One day I hope to retire there so I can focus on my passions of surfing and glassblowing.",
